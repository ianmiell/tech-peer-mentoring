why
often you get to the point where you want to learn something you've never learned, but want to be guided through it rather than watch lots of videos.
suggest you have a project in mind, as it helps structure the learning. you can learn outside the session, or stumble through within each hour - the time is yours.
interview process - linkedin, github
will not be 'trad' process - basically we'll chat and I might ask you to help me learn something (ie not a whiteboard google type affair)
expertises
timezone
1 hour each per week, divided into two halves? can change it on agreement
getting out of it
anyone is free to drop out at any time - if you're not comfortable telling people that, then you can tell me. if you have feedback, let me know.
