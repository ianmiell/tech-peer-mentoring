# Tech Peer Mentoring

## What

- Software professionals matched for mutual one-on-one mentoring

- No money changes hands

- Informal - you can drop out at any time



## Problem

In software you can easily get to a point where you are expert in one field in
software, but relatively ignorant in another.

You want to learn something you've never learned, but lack time and want to be
guided through it by someone similarly experienced rather than watch lots of
videos or stumble around.

## Solution

This service seeks to match people to one another so they can mentor each other
to develop skills in a symmetrical way.

You won't need to be a great expert on a topic!

While it is hoped that if you know at least a little more than your mentee on a
subject, the act of mentoring will help you learn the subject in more depth.

## How

The service is run via a google group:

tech-peer-mentoring@googlegroups.com

If your application is accepted (see below for Application info), you can either
solicit mutual mentoring through the group forum, or contact the moderator, who
can find someone appropriate and hook you up.

Once matched, it's suggested to have a first trial session to see if you're well
matched.

It's suggested you start by dividing the hour into two halves, and swap the
direction of mentoring on the half hour. Later you might prefer to alternate, or
make it more free-form.

After that, agree and commit to a time for one hour a week
and a means of communication, or drop out if you think it won't work out.

You are free to renegotiate this any of this with your assigned partner as you
wish.

Some guidance:

- You might want to have a project in mind to be helped through. This helps structure the learning for both sides.

- You can learn outside the session (recommended), or just pick up where you left off.


## Applications

Application to the group is not like for a job. If you pass the first stage (which is a
sanity check of your credentials), there will be a short Skype/Hangout chat (or
similar).

There will be no 'whiteboarding' or algorithm, or direct technical questions. The purpose is to work out what
you want from the process, and what you can offer so you can be appropriately
matched.


## How to Apply

Apply to ian.miell@gmail.com, with some links to relevant material (eg LinkedIn,
GitHub), a brief description of what you want to get out of the process, and
a list of skills you think you can offer.


## FAQs

Q. What if I want to drop out?

A. You can drop out at any time. You can either let the other person know
yourself or if you're not comfortable with that, mail ian.miell@gmail.com and
I'll let them know. It helps me if you give feedback in these cases.

It is most likely that people drop out because they find the time commitment
difficult. Please bear that in mind.

Q. Will this be monetized? 

A. No.

Q. What kind of skills can I offer?

A. Anything you think relevant/useful. Could be anything from 'vim' to 'general programming'. The categories are up to you.
