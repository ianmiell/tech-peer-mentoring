# Tech Peer Mentoring

## What

- Software professionals matched for mutual one-on-one mentoring

- No money changes hands

- Informal - you can drop out at any time



## Problem

In software you can easily get to a point where you are expert in one field in
software, but relatively ignorant in another.

You want to learn something you've never learned, but lack time and want to be
guided through it by someone similarly experienced rather than watch lots of
videos or stumble around.

## Solution

This service seeks to match people to one another so they can mentor each other
to develop skills in a symmetrical way.

You won't need to be a great expert on a topic!

While it is hoped that if you know at least a little more than your mentee on a
subject, the act of mentoring will help you learn the subject in more depth.

## How

The service is run via a google group:

tech-peer-mentoring@googlegroups.com

If your application is accepted (see below for Application info), you can either
solicit mutual mentoring through the group forum, or contact the moderator, who
can find someone appropriate and hook you up.

Once matched, it's suggested to agree and commit to a time for one hour a week
and a means of communication.

It's suggested you start by dividing the hour into two halves, and swap the
direction of mentoring on the half hour. Later you might prefer to alternate, or
make it more free-form.

You are free to renegotiate this any of this with your assigned partner as you
wish.

Some guidance:

- You might want to have a project in mind to be helped through. This helps structure the learning for both sides.

- You can learn outside the session (recommended), or just pick up where you left off.


## Applications

Application is not like for a job. If you pass the first stage (which is a
sanity check of your credentials), there will be a short Skype/Hangout chat (or
similar).

There will be no 'whiteboarding' type questions. The purpose is to work out what
you want from the process, and what you can offer so you can be appropriately
matched.


## How to Apply

Apply to ian.miell@gmail.com, with some links to relevant material (eg LinkedIn,
GitHub), a brief description of what you want to get out of the process, and
a list of skills you think you can offer.


## FAQs

Q. What if I want to drop out?

A. You can drop out at any time. You can either let the other person know
yourself or if you're not comfortable with that, mail ian.miell@gmail.com and
I'll let them know. It helps me if you give feedback in these cases.

It is most likely that people drop out because they find the time commitment
difficult. Please bear that in mind.

Q. Will this be monetized? Will my email be shared/sold/stored in a database?

A. No.




### Links and Email
#### Inline
Just put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable: <uranusjr@gmail.com>  
`<uranusjr@gmail.com>`  

Same thing with urls: <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>  
` <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>`  

Perhaps you want to some link text like this: [Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")  
`[Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")` (The title is optional)  


#### Reference style
Sometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together.  

Make [a link][arbitrary_id] `[a link][arbitrary_id]` then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"`
  
If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link [like this][] `[like this][]`, then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com`  

[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"
[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com
